        <h2>Marijuana legalization sows chaos in California</h2>

      <div class="bod">
        <p><strong>Eureka, California -- </strong>Amid the constant drone of helicopters, DEA raids, widescale asset forfeitures, and against all odds, northern California’s cannabis farmers have thrived, creating a system of smallholder farming that turned California into one of the world’s biggest producers of marijuana on planet earth.</p>
        <p>Yet the thousands of marijuana farms that dot the Emerald Triangle – the counties of Humboldt, Mendocino and Trinity, which are the heart of marijuana country -- and the local economies they have come to support may soon grind to a halt, hamstrung and handicapped by the most unlikely of culprits: legalization.</p>
        <p>Far from straightforward, the process of legalization in California has opened Pandora’s box, completely rejigging the political-economy of marijuana and ushering in a tsunami of change. And the roughly twenty thousand or so farms in Northern California -- many of whom helped forge a system of small-holder farming that could be ripped out directly from a UN development report (minus the marijuana) – may lose out completely.</p>
        <p>Burdensome regulation requirements and the maelstrom of market liberalization favor big enterprises flush with cash and credit. It’s the system of “get big or go home”, says Fred Krissman an anthropologist at Humboldt State University.</p>
        <p>“Within 30 years, on a completely different model, on a non-agribusiness model, this industry arose here, and now it is doomed to be scooped up in the legalization process by people who are not part of cannabis culture at all,” says Krissman.</p>

        <h3>“Death by a thousand papercuts”</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <div class="bod">
        <p>The inexhaustible knowledge of “budtenders” – pot shop employees – the medley of marijuana products, and the doctor’s office-like sterility of California’s cannabis dispensaries all communicate order and calm.</p>
        <p>But follow the supply chain back to the producer and you quickly see that legalization in its current guise is creating a seemingly endless series of externalities, some foreseen, some not, belying this calm. It is chaotic, and the disorder is running many small producers out of business.</p>
        <p>Reliable numbers around marijuana are hard to come by, but Hezekiah Allen, the former executive director of the California Growers Association, estimates that already 20,000 farms and businesses have been lost, and says that California is at risk of losing 20,000 more “if we don’t change course quickly”.</p>
        <p>Part of this is due to the burdensome permitting process. Expensive and complicated, growers have to pass through a seemingly endless series of bureaucratic hoops, says Allen, that may require them to move locations or upgrade their facilities, all of which is costly and time-consuming, especially for small-scale farmers, many of whom are already at the end of their credit.</p>
        <p>And selling directly to consumers through farmers markets, tastings, or direct retail, which many farmers depended on before legalization, says Allen, is now, under legalization, no longer legal.</p>
        <p>“That’s making it really hard for a lot of them to survive, especially after more than a decade of participating in events or maintaining a direct relationship with consumers,” says Allen.</p>
        <p>“It’s sort of a death by a thousand papercuts sort of a scenario.”</p>

        <p>But even permitted small-scale farmers are struggling to stay afloat, drowning under the rock-bottom prices for marijuana which resulted from legalization. To survive, some of them are adopting practices that contravene current regulations, says Krissman, whose current work involves studying labor conditions on small-scale legal marijuana grows.</p>
        <p>“All the businesses I am studying are still in business, but they are massively violating regulations to stay in business. They are operating illegal trim scenes, out of desperation,” says Krissman.</p>
        <p>Other growers are waiting to see what will happen, still incredulous of earlier state efforts to bring marijuana from out of the shadows.</p>
        <p>In 2010, the Mendocino sheriff’s office pioneered a permitting process for medical cannabis growers that put them in compliance with environmental laws, explains Anthony Silvaggio, an environmental sociologist at the Humboldt State University.</p>
        <p>The program became known as the “zip-tie program” for the zip ties law enforcement fastened around plants on grow sites that complied with environmental standards. Law enforcement wouldn’t touch grows in the program, and as a consequence many growers eventually jumped on board, says Silvaggio.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, the federal government eventually got wind of the program and subpoenaed the records of everyone involved, making several arrests, and destroying what was a “model program”, according to Silvaggio. What little trust most growers had of law enforcement and the federal government at that point dissolved, feeding the ambivalence of many growers to get permitted now.</p>
        <p>“As legalization kicked into effect here many folks felt this was just going to be the same old dog and pony show for the feds,” says Silvaggio. “So, it’s taken folks a long time to come to the understanding that they needed to get into compliance.”</p>
        <p>For many of the much smaller mom and pops operations legalization just doesn’t seem worth it. It is too chaotic, there is too much bureaucracy, and it is too expensive. Roy, an 80-year-old retiree, started cultivating cannabis a few years ago to prop up his pension (he didn’t want his last name used for security reasons). He puts the blame square on the shoulders of politicians and regulators.</p>
        <p>“Even people that are making the rules don’t know what’s going on. It’s like having someone who has never driven a car try to teach you how to drive,” says Roy.</p>
        <p>Legalization is a process, and like any process, it is going to take some time to fine tune the regulations, says Tamar Todd, a lawyer at the American Civilities Liberties Union.</p>
        <p>For the time being it is a complete mess, says Krissman, an “utter fiasco of unending duhs and headslaps.”</p>
        <p>Of the estimated 30,000 marijuana operations in the Emerald Triangle only 941 currently have permits to grow legally.</p>

        <h3>It's all about the consumer</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <div class="bod">
        <p>Legalization hasn’t been a complete catastrophe. Just ask any one of the millions of pot consumers in California that can walk into a dispensary and purchase a potpourri of products including: edibles, pot powder, CBD-infused water, vape pens, oils, and hundreds of different kinds of marijuana buds.</p>
        <p>Prices may be high – given the state’s high tax rate – but consumers appreciate not having to go through the awkward steps of buying from a dealer or being arrested for simply smoking a joint.</p>
        <p>A big part of legalization concerned criminal justice – reducing the amount of people, mostly minorities, that were being unjustly arrested and imprisoned for marijuana offenses. And where marijuana has been legalized in the US, it is meeting this intended target.</p>
        <p>“Generally what we’ve seen is that arrests have dropped around marijuana,” says Todd.</p>
        <p>Legalization has also forced growers to adopt more environmental growing practices, which means less pesticides in the environment and less pesticides in those consuming the product -- a win for nature and customer alike.</p>
        <p>“What we’re seeing now is that people are trying to move away from pesticide use, because none of their shit is passing tests,” says Silvaggio. “Their stuff comes back dirty and they can’t sell it on regulated markets.”</p>
        <p>But under legalization’s current legislation, nothing is certain, and even these measures could come under attack.</p>

        <h3>A “high paid influencer” and conflicts of interest</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <div class="bod">
        <p>Before the passing of Proposition 64, Krissman authored a <a href="https://hiimr.humboldt.edu/sites/default/files/hiimr/docs/MjLaborMarket.pdf" target="_blank">paper portending</a> how an influx of big money interests, supporting a corporate big agribusiness model, would smother the smallholder marijuana farming in Northern California and transplant the industry to the traditional agricultural hubs of central California.</p>
        <p>The Cannabis Advisory Committee (CAC) was ultimately established to combat this threat. It would advise the regulating agencies, including the Bureau of Cannabis Control, the California Department of Food and Agriculture and the California Department of Public Health, on the best ways to implement legalization.</p>
        <p>Part of what the CAC recommended was an acreage cap for permit holders, which would limit the number of cultivatable acres for cannabis. Originally set to one acre, the cap would serve as a buffer for smallholder farmers while they came into compliance, says Allen, protecting them from the massive flow of venture capital that would wash into the market in 2023 when the cap was supposed to be lifted.</p>
        <p>“The acreage cap was dangled to begin with because they knew they had to give assurances to the small farmers and the region – primarily the emerald triangle – that was dependent on cottage industry, small family farming, and ‘trimmigrants’ to an extent,” says Krissman.</p>
        <p>But for Krissman, who has spent his career studying the US agricultural system and the detrimental effects of “big-ag” on America’s small-farmers, the proposal was inadequate.</p>
        <p>“I was opposed to prop 64 because in my mind a five-year moratorium on acreage caps wasn’t enough. It should have been a permanent thing,” he says.</p>
        <p>“It should have been, hey we have one goddamned crop industry that’s based on traditional American small family farming. Let’s keep this.”</p>
        <p>To the surprise of many, when Proposition 64 was passed -- officially legalizing marijuana -- the acreage cap disappeared entirely.</p>
        <p>“The Department of Food and Agriculture opened up a loophole that allowed large growers to enter the market immediately,” says Allen.</p>
        <p>This meant that far from protecting smallholder farmers, which was enshrined in Proposition 64, the Department of Food and Agriculture opened up California’s marijuana market to full-scale liberalization.</p>
        <p>For Allen, removing the acreage cap was a “clear and obvious sign of capture.” The Department of Food and Agriculture never gave any explanation, and to date they still haven’t issued any official statement elucidating their drastic change of stance.</p>
        <p>“And since then there was a turning point when the agency stopped being responsive to input and began implementing another agenda,” says Allen.</p>
        <p>The California Grower’s Association filed suit against the California Department of Food and Agriculture, <a href="https://www.sacbee.com/news/state/california/california-weed/article196400149.html" target="_blank">stating that</a> “approving large cultivation operations in 2018 will significantly reduce the ability of small and medium businesses to compete economically in the regulated market.”</p>
        <p>Allen has his own theory on how the acreage cap was lifted, believing a “high-paid influencer” got involved.</p>
        <p>“Somebody who had their ear got to them. There were not that many businesses that benefited from this,” says Allen.</p>
        <p>Multiple requests for an explanation from the California Department of Food and Agriculture resulted in the following response: “The issue of a more restrictive acreage cap for cannabis cultivation in California is the subject of ongoing litigation and the California Department of Food and Agriculture does not comment on ongoing litigation.”</p>

        <h3>Economic shock therapy </h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <div class="bod">
        <p>Lifting the acreage cap dramatically changed the direction of how California’s marijuana production would be operated. By liberalizing the entire marijuana market overnight, and putting no limits on the number of permits companies could obtain, and ex oficio, the amount of land they could cultivate, California was effectively issuing its own version of economic shock therapy.</p>
        <p>Large scale operations have already popped up in traditional farming areas, like Salinas in Monterey County. And Santa Barbara has seen an influx in big operations targeting the Los Angeles market.</p>

    <div class="container">
      <div class="bod">
        <p>Grupo Flor and Harborside are two larger businesses based in Salinas that are critical to cultivation limits, arguing that the market not the government should decide the future of marijuana production.</p>
        <p>“We have to be more creative and not take something out of Lenin’s playbook,” Steve DeAngelo, the owner of Harborside told the <a href="https://www.sacbee.com/news/state/california/california-weed/article208499009.html" target="_blank">Sacramento Bee</a>, referring to the protective measures for small-scale farmers enshrined in the original version of Proposition 64.</p>
        <p>A far cry from the mom and pops operations of Northern California, these indoor, “cannabis campuses”, as they’re called, are massive in size -- some as big as ten football fields. Bolstered by big money, favorable legislation, and located in areas with an already established network of heavy farming infrastructure, these Salinas and Santa Barbara are becoming the new bastions of cannabis cultivation.</p>
        <p>California was already overproducing marijuana before legalization, says Silvaggio, and lifting the acreage cap pumped the markets full of pot, bottoming out cannabis prices to $500 a pound, making it even harder for small farmers and businesses to survive.</p>
        <p>The incentive now is to grow as much as possible, or have access to enough investment capital to weather the storm.</p>
        <p>“Heavily capitalized businesses are surviving,” says Dominic Corva, the executive director at the Center for the Study of Cannabis and Social Policy. “They’re meant to lose money until everyone else is out of business.”</p>
        <p>Tech venture capital from Silicon Valley has swooped in, as have big Canadian companies, like Canna Royalty, says Allen, who embrace a different ethos from the growers in the Emerald Triangle.</p>
        <p>“We have that whole tech venture capital move fast and break things mentality. There’s going to be a thousand and only one is going to make it,” says Allen.</p>
        <p>“That’s very different from the small farming culture, where we sort of make it together.”</p>

        <p>Todd admits that including small farmers in the process of legalization is important, but she is businesslike in her assessment.</p>

        <p>State politicians seem uninterested in the issue, which comes as no surprise to Corva, who has witnessed similar political apathy in Washington, where marijuana is also legal.  Having a fresh stream of revenue pumping into the cash-strapped budgets of many states is convenient for politicians, explains Corva.</p>
        <p>“It [marijuana] generates a shit-ton of revenue. What happened ten years ago wrecked states’ budgets. So, having some new revenue producer for them is huge. They don’t have to screw around with their income tax or sales tax structure,” says Corva.</p>
        <p>The economic expediency of pot allows politicians to look the other way – at least for now -- when it comes to failing farms and businesses.</p>
        <p>“Nobody gives a shit what happens to weed producers. There is no political constituency that really cares about them. The sooner you can get to Walmart the better,” says Corva. “That’s normal for the American economy. That’s how it’s supposed to happen.”</p>
        <p>With no real mediator outside of the free-market, the future of small farms, businesses and the economies of the Emerald Triangle is looking grim.</p>

        <h3>The “trimmigrant” trail comes to an end</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <div class="bod">
        <p>“Trimmigrants” – workers who clip the buds from marijuana plants – used to come into town on busses, says Raoul Rodriguez, a marijuana grower himself and also a barista at a local café in Eureka’s old-town. On the weekends, they would flood the café and the surrounding stores, spending the thousands of dollars they’d made in cash during the week. But the trimmigrant train has thinned out to a trickle this year.</p>
        <p>With cannabis prices plummeting, the once lucrative salary of a trimmer has been halved. Many of the current trimmigrants are European and are working under increasingly precarious and dangerous conditions.</p>
        <p>Antoine has been coming to California for the past two years to trim (he didn’t want his last name used for security reasons). While his first year went smoothly, he has had several harry run ins with some of the grow owners he worked for this year. One paranoid owner pulled a gun on him, accusing him of stealing, says Antoine. Another owner still owes him $2800, which he doesn’t expect to get.</p>
        <p>In the burgeoning industrial centers for marijuana production, such as Salinas, more and more employees are Latino, reflecting the labor policies of these agricultural hubs, and heralding what will likely be the labor norm in the near future, says Krissman.</p>

        <h3>The black market is still vibrant</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <div class="bod">
        <p>Legalization was in theory supposed to eliminate California’s black market, but it is increasingly having the opposite effect. In states with no legal market for weed, a pound of marijuana still fetches $2000, says Silvaggio. For farmers struggling to stay in business, selling to the black market offers some breathing room, an insurance policy of sorts, while they work through California’s legalization process.</p>
        <p>“Those growers that are in the regulated process also have non-regulated black-market cultivation sites. An overwhelming majority do,” says Silvaggio.</p>
        <p>And a lot of small farmers and mom and pops operations never intended to go legal, says Krissman, preferring the more profitable and less burdensome black market.</p>
        <p>But Allen warns that the ongoing existence of a robust black market will give rise to a whole suite of other challenges, such as the environment.</p>

        <h3>Legalization backfiring on environmental promises</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <div class="bod">
        <p>The uptick in aerial surveillance may encourage many renegade black market growers to go back indoors, similar to what happened in the “diesel dope” years under Reagan, says Silvaggio, especially if the price for indoor weed stays high. These generator powered grows tend to not only to be a constant source of noise pollution, but they often leak into the surrounding nature.</p>
        <p>As more and more small-scale regulated growers struggle to survive tanking pot prices, Silvaggio worries that they also may revert to clear cutting more tracts of land.</p>
        <p>“The fear is that we are going to see more illegal conversion of forest land, so that they can grow more cannabis. You have to grow more because the price is lower,” says Silvaggio.</p>
        <p>And by lifting the acreage cap, the state is implicitly endorsing practices that run contrary to the environmental legislation set out in Proposition 64.</p>
        <p>“The state wants to regulate environmental issues. Yet the state, the Bureau of Cannabis Control, they’re permitting large scale indoor facilities in places where you can grow outdoor. They’re fulling permitting indoor facilities where the C02 footprint is just incredible,” says Silvaggio.</p>
        <p>And if there are certain conflicts of interest in various regulatory bodies, as various experts claim, this may also result in the relaxation of pesticide and water controls.</p>
        <p>“We’re very concerned that those things will be eroded over time,” says Allen. “At this point today, cannabis in California is a leader in sustainable agriculture. That may not last. It’s expensive. We’ll see.”</p>

        <h3>The end of an era</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <div class="bod">
        <p>Against every effort by law enforcement, the early pioneers and renegade growers of the Emerald Triangle turned California into one of the world’s biggest cannabis cultivator. And they managed to do this using a system of progressive smallholder farming, a system arrayed against big ag, big corporations, and the ethos of going big or going home that seems to sit at the center of modern America.</p>
        <p>Yet, with a simple flick of free-market’s tail, the entire edifice of the Emerald Triangle looks set to fall.</p>
        <p>Raoul will put in one more year in California. He already paid for the permit. But afterwards, he like many others is checking out. He will head to New Mexico to try his luck in the state’s medical marijuana market.</p>
        <p>The tens of thousands of farms in the Emerald Triangle and local economies they support face a long path of uncertainty. The region has lived through numerous booms and busts. But this is different.</p>
        <p>“What it looks like is a big mess. If you came back here in five years and tried to find this place to have a cup of coffee, it will be closed, and half the store-fronts will be boarded up in old town,” says Krissman.</p>
        <p>“The economy will be completely shot and everyone will be trying to get out. Kind of like the aftermath of the fishing and the timber industry but with nothing else really in site to replace cannabis in this region.”</p>
