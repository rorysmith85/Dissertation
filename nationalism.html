        <h2>Far-right nationalists want to rubber-stamp war on drugs</h2>
      </div>

        <p>At one point as an adolescent, Adolph Hitler got <a href="https://digitalcommons.unf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1022&context=ahis_facpub" target="_blank">so drunk</a> at a graduation party, that he tore up his diploma and used it as toilet paper.</p>
        <p>The humiliating episode impelled Hitler to abstemiousness and underpinned his intolerance towards alcohol and vice, a prejudice he would later use to sterilize alcoholics and put them into concentration camps, says David Courtwright, a drug historian at the University of North Florida.</p>
        <p>While the events leading to Hitler’s animosity towards vice may be unique, his hardline stance is hardly an aberration among authoritarian states, according to Courtwright, who says that “nationalist ideologies tend to be highly compatible with relatively restricted drug policies.”</p>
        <p>Canada may have recently legalized marijuana, and there may be certain fractures in the Vienna Consensus, according to the International Drug Policy Consortium (IDPC), but as more far-right nationalist leaders jump on the political bandwagon -- many of whom favor tough drug policies -- the world may be seeing a dramatic rejuvenation of drug prohibition.</p>
        <p>Courtwright is loath to speculate as a historian, but he sees the rise in populist nationalist leaders across the world, and their rhetorical support for tough drug policies as possible “straws in the wind”.</p>

        <h3>War on drugs is winning for the right</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <div class="bod">
        <p>Rampant extrajudicial killings, a steep increase in drug-related deaths, and the continued growth of the cultivation, consumption, and illegal trafficking of drugs were all reasons cited in IDPC’s recent report evidencing how the war on drugs has failed.</p>
        <p>"This report is another nail in the coffin for the war on drugs," said Ann Fordham, the Executive Director of IDPC.</p>
        <p>Yet, nationalist leaders across the world – including president Duterte of the Philippines, president Putin of Russia, president Duque of Colombia, and most recently the president-elect Bolsonaro of Brazil, and president Trump to a certain extent -- continue supporting strict and often militaristic drug policies.</p>

        <p>Putin even went as far as to wage a war on cigarettes and alcohol, says Courtwright, which in a sense fits the historical mold.</p>
        <p>“Any society that has an organic view of the state believes that maintaining the health and morale and readiness of the population as a component to national security is necessarily going to be concerned about the abuse of drugs,” says Courtwright.</p>
        <p>But more often, nationalist leaders enact hardline drug policies for more nefarious reasons.</p>
        <p>“It is very appealing to autocratic regimes, as a form of social control, which is what the drug war has always been about,” according to Sanho Tree, director of the Drug Policy Project at the Institute for Policy Studies, who says that it has been an expedient tool to control populations associated with drugs.</p>
        <p>But even healthy democracies have used the drug war for politically motivated reasons. John Ehrlichman, the former domestic policy chief for Richard Nixon, revealed to journalist Dan Baum in 1994, the real reasons for Nixon’s drug war: to legally take down the administrations two enemies at the time – the anti-war left and black people.</p>
        <p>“We knew we couldn’t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities,” said Ehrlichman.</p>
        <p>“We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.”</p>
        <p>Autocrats also employ tough drug policies to cover up developmental or structural problems afflicting their countries, says Tree, referring to Duterte’s policy in the Philippines.</p>
        <p>“He has taken all these annoyances and problems of poverty in the Philippines and rolled it up and said there’s your scapegoat, get rid of them and things will be better,” says Tree.</p>
        <p>In response to the ongoing opioid crisis, president Trump proposed making drug trafficking a capital offense, and has openly supported Duterte’s drug strategy, which has resulted in more than 12,000 extrajudicial killings.</p>

        <h3>What about marijuana?</h3>

    <div class="container">
      <div class="bod">
        <p>Though 33 US states have passed some form of marijuana legalization – suggesting a loosening of overall drug policy -- America remains severely divided over cannabis.</p>
        <p>“It’s much less susceptible to liberalization in red states than it is in blue states, other things being equal,” says Courtwright. “The stigma is still there and marijuana is still a culture-war football.”</p>
        <p>Despite 10 states and the District of Colombia having legalized recreational marijuana, the total number of marijuana arrests has been rising in the US. And ethnic minorities, primarily blacks and Hispanics, are still more likely to be arrested for possession even where it is legal.</p>

        <h3>Fracture? What fracture?</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <div class="bod">
        <p>In 2009, UN member states reapproved their ongoing commitment to create a drug free world in what is known as the “Vienna Consensus” – effectively endorsing a continued war on drugs.</p>
        <p>In the following years, dissident voices from the public-health community denounced the war on drugs, promoting instead a strategy of harm-reduction, and created what many, including the IDPC, called a facture in the consensus.</p>

        <p>But the idea of a fracture is overstated says Alex Soderholm, policy coordinator at the London School of Economics Drug Policy Unity. Countries are experimenting with different policies, such as Portugal and Canada, but “there aren’t really states that are strong enough to stand up and build a coalition and break open the drug conventions as it were.”</p>
        <p>The election of Trump and the subsequent right-wing movements around the world have in a way reaffirmed the consensus.</p>
        <p>“He’s been supportive of these right-wing agendas when it comes to drugs elsewhere, so he’s still supporting and exporting that kind of old model of the war on drugs,” says Soderholm.</p>
        <p>And given the centrality of the US in shaping international policy, Soderholm believes that “we’re going to see more of these extreme versions of the debate.”</p>

        <h3>Empirical evidence or easy narrative?</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <div class="bod">
        <p>The inefficacy and costliness of the war on drugs has been clearly highlighted by numerous experts and studies, many of which are laid out in the IDPC report, including increased overdose deaths.</p>
        <p>The harm-reduction model – which aims to prevent the harm of drug use instead of preventing drugs themselves – is often touted as the most effective alternative way of dealing with drugs, and Portugal’s success in reducing overdose deaths is foremost among the model’s triumphs.</p>
        <p>In the 90s Portugal was gripped by a heroin overdose epidemic. But in the early 2000s Portugal embraced what was then a radical approach to drug policy: decriminalization. Furthermore, they treated addiction as a health problem rather than a criminal problem. The pivot resulted in Portugal having one of the lowest rates of overdose deaths in all of Europe.</p>
        <p>But the Portuguese model incorporated around 120 different strategies, says Soderholm, highlighting the complexity of effective and sustainable solutions to drug abuse.</p>
        <p>And complexity doesn’t generally do well in debates around drug policy, highlighting why these policies aren’t rolled out across the world.</p>
        <p>“There’s a lot of research on these topics, but we don’t have all the answers,” says Soderholm. “We don’t know exactly how a regulated model of cocaine and heroin use would work. We don’t know the long-term implications of that.”</p>
        <p>The effects of drugs are very visible, and saying no to all drugs, which is the general narrative of many nationalist leaders, is easier, says Soderholm.</p>
        <p>These voices are also much more vocal than those in the harm reduction camp.</p>
        <p>“The voices from the other camp are getting louder and louder, with the election of Trump, in Colombia, and with Bolsonaro in Brazil,” says Soderholm. “These voices are much louder and they’re selling a policy option that is much easier to understand for people.”</p>

        <h3>A future of foreboding</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <div class="bod">
        <p>Marijuana legalization in Canada, Uruguay, and the 33 states in the US, as well as progressive drug policies in Europe, such as Portugal, are petri dishes of experimentation. But it will take a while to see the long-term results of this policy experimentation, says Tree.</p>
        <p>That might not be the worst outcome in the short run, especially if you are in a country supporting harm-reduction, says Tree, but it’s unfortunate for the people behind the autocratic regimes supporting tough drug policy. Nonetheless, those in the harm-reduction camp “can move on and show by doing you can accomplish these things and the sky won’t fall.”</p>
        <p>But for progressive drug policy experimentation to be successful, according to Soderholm, it will require bringing different camps into the conversation to address issues such as poverty, inequality, and social exclusion -- complex issues that are highly political and highly unfavorable to forging an easy narrative.</p>
        <p>“That’s a much much broader debate and much more complex and difficult debate than saying no, we’re just going to say no to all drugs, and all drugs are bad. That’s much catchier, unfortunately.”</p>
