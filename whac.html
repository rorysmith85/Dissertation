        <p><strong>Hayfork, California -- </strong>The closest thing to a suspect that law enforcement finds on a raid most times are statues of the <em>Virgen de Guadalupe</em> or <em>Jesus Malverde</em> – the patron saint of Mexican drug traffickers. Having spotted the approaching authorities, sometimes from miles away, the growers disappear as discreetly and mysteriously as they arrive.</p>
        <p>What’s left behind on these illegal public land marijuana grows -- or ‘gardens’ as law enforcement likes to call them -- are thousands of pounds of irrigation line, fertilizer, banned pesticides, swimming pool-sized reservoirs of diverted water, and millions of dollars’ worth of pot plants.</p>
        <p>Thousands of illegal marijuana grow sites – orchestrated, it’s thought, by organized crime groups from Mexico – pop up on California’s public lands each year. And they are becoming increasingly toxic, employing more and more poisonous pesticides. The number of sites may have decreased in 2018, but it’s doubtful these groups are going away.</p>

        <p>Burt Clark, a big, bearded Hayfork local, who could easily be confused for a 49er or timberman, spends part of his summer cleaning up – or “reclaiming” as it’s officially called – illegal marijuana grows on public lands.</p>
        <p>For Burt, the reduction in numbers doesn’t necessarily mean the groups running these grows are going away. He thinks that the organizations “are getting more sneaky about it.”</p>
        <p>“We’ve seen em where there’s manzanita and then the plants [marijuana] are in between the manzanita so they’re hidden down in there. They cover their tracks a little bit better.”</p>
        <p>Legalization may have slashed the bottom out of cannabis prices in California, but it has done little to stymie public land cannabis cultivations, the product of which flows East, where it fetches much higher prices. And the criminal groups tending these “gardens” have pivoted strategies, explaining, in part, the significant uptick in toxic chemicals being found at both public and private land grows as well as why they are becoming harder to find. As the process of legalization continues piecemeal in the US, law enforcement will likely be playing the cat and mouse game with growers long into the future.</p>

        <h3>The “center of the universe for cannabis”</h3>
      </div>

    <div class="container">
      <div class="bod">
        <p>Illegal marijuana grows have long been present on public lands across the US, having been found in 38 states. So too has the tonnage of trash, fertilizer, piping, pesticides, and devastating environmental damage associated with these grows.</p>
        <p>But the problem is particularly acute in California. Of the 26 million marijuana plants seized on national forest land since 2001, nearly 90% of these plants were found in California.</p>
        <p>California is the “center of the universe for cannabis” says Anthony Silvaggio, a sociologist at Humboldt State University.</p>
        <p>With almost 21 million acres of national forests, California ranks only behind Alaska in terms of acreage. Vast stretches of remote and impenetrable terrain, constant sunlight, and a relative dearth of law enforcement officials coalesce to create some of the world’s best conditions for clandestine marijuana grows.</p>

        <p>After a long, hard-fought season of eradication efforts, sidetracked in part by a series of fierce fires that ripped through marijuana country, law enforcement and ecologists have noticed an alarming uptick in the amount of hazardous chemicals being used at grow sites in 2018.</p>
        <p>“This year we have a decrease in sites but an increase of chemicals,” says Mourad Gabriel, the head ecologist at the Integral Ecology Research Center (IERC), and who over the years has become the leading expert on the ecological impacts of illegal grows on public lands.</p>
        <p>“These grow sites have a far larger chemical footprint than what has previously gone on.”</p>

        <p>Kyle Van Atta moves adeptly along the steep, terraced slopes of “Bar 717” – a raided marijuana grow high up in the rugged mountains outside of Hyampom. As an ecologist at the IERC, much of his work involves hiking the steep mountainsides of Northern California to map public land grow sites and track the various pesticides and rodenticides being used at these grows.</p>
        <p>“It’s kind of like that whac-a-mole approach,” says Van Atta, describing how sites continuously pop up in the national forests, despite efforts by law enforcement.</p>
        <p>Having found the biohazard bucket he was looking for, he opens the lid, revealing a bottle of Carbofuran that the IERC team found and quarantined after the initial raid on Bar 717.</p>

      <div class="bod">
        <p>Carbofuran is a highly toxic pesticide, a quarter-teaspoon of which can kill a full-sized black bear, according the Gabriel. Toxic pesticides such as carbofuran, which is banned in the US, were found at 89% of public land grows in 2018., marking a steep increase from 2012, when toxic pesticides were present on only around 15% of illegal grow sites.</p>
        <p>At one location this year, the IERC team found 9 bottles of carbofuran on a grow that needed only half a bottle for the number of plants there. And the use of methamidophos – another banned toxic pesticide -- has also been “severely ramped up”, says Gabriel.</p>
        <p>Many of these areas are prime habitats for various threatened species, including the Pacific Fisher and the Northern Spotted Owl. And various rivers and watersheds that feed California’s water supply and are breeding grounds for salmon have tested positive for many of these same chemicals.</p>
        <p>Beyond the ecological impact of using these chemicals, Gabriel also worries about the consumer.</p>
        <p>“When we match those chemicals [methamidophos] with what California is testing for we’re noticing that these are all new chemicals that will circumvent screening processes,” warns Gabriel, suggesting that this tainted marijuana may sneak its way to the licit supply and eventually into the consumer.</p>
        <p>Even law enforcement is worried. Earlier this summer, a sheriff’s officer from Mendocino County was hospitalized after <a href="https://www.mendovoice.com/2018/07/methamidophos-mcso-deputy/" target="_blank">coming into contact with carbofuran.</a></p>

        <h3>The specter of Mexican cartels</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <div class="bod">
        <p>U.S. Forest Service Chief Forester Vicki Christiansen has suggested that drug traffickers operate on 72 national forests in 21 different states in the US. But getting to the bottom of who operates and organizes the public land grows in California and across the US is as daunting a task as apprehending the workers tending these grows.</p>
        <p>The few growers that are apprehended are usually undocumented low-tier field workers, oftentimes from Mexico, that have little to no knowledge of who they work for. They spend the scorching summer months marooned in remote regions of California, doing the back-breaking work needed to establish grow sites and then cultivate the thousands of plants generally found at each one of these “gardens”.</p>
        <p>Their pay is conditioned on the amount of product they can produce, which is a reason some suspects give for using the banned pesticides found at many grow sites, according to Sergeant Nathaniel Trujillo, a narcotics expert with the Trinity County sheriff's department.</p>
        <p>And when they are paid – assuming the site isn’t found and eradicated – it generally only amounts to a few thousand dollars at most. It may be a lot for some of these workers but is chump-change when compared to the millions of dollars the product will fetch on the black market.</p>
        <p>Yet, the sophisticated engineering methods being employed on these incredibly remote grow sites – including the use of miles of irrigation pipes, the construction of cisterns the size of swimming pools to feed these pipes, and the cloning of marijuana plants – like the organizational prowess needed to get this material to these remote grows, is evidence enough for Charles Lee, a federal defender in the Eastern District of California, to suggest some bigger entities may be involved.</p>
        <p>“Someone has got to set this up, to get all the raw materials up there, to get the seed, to get the fertilizer, to get the equipment up there, to set up this type of watering system,” says Lee.</p>
        <p>“So that tends to support the fact that somebody with some deep pockets is doing this. Or is behind it or is organizing it.”</p>

        <p>Sergeant Trujillo has worked numerous cases involving public grows over the years, but he is reluctant to use the term “Mexican cartels”. He prefers to call the groups underwriting these operations “Hispanic drug trafficking organizations”.</p>
        <p>He can’t pinpoint which particular organizations are involved, but through some of his investigations he has seen money flowing back to Mexico.</p>
        <p>Those Mexican cartels who are most often cited by law enforcement as having their hands in California’s marijuana mason jar are Generación Nueva de Jalisco and the long-standing Sinaloa cartel.</p>
        <p>Mexican drug trafficking groups utilize long overlapping supply chains to move their product. And while their influence tendrils through the US -- employing US-based gangs and organized criminal groups along the way -- the sovereignty of Uncle Sam isn’t being threatened by any cartel incursions from across the border, says Rodrigo Nieto-Gomez, a research professor at the Naval Postgraduate School in California.</p>
        <p>Chris Boehm, the Deputy Director of Forest Service Law Enforcement and Investigations, calls the relationship between public land grows and organized crime in Mexico “almost private contractor-like”.</p>
        <p>The individuals, or groups setting up these groups, may work for somebody in Mexico, but the “cashier is in the US”.</p>
        <p>“They may get some seed money to grow some of these sites, and they may also get some level of protection during harvest time,” says Boehm. “But then they’re expected to produce a certain amount of marijuana plants that goes over to the cartel distribution channels.”</p>
        <p>But putting a finger on who is exactly in Mexico is providing this seed money continues to bedevil law enforcement and researchers.</p>

        <h3>Changing tactics</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <div class="bod">
        <p>In 2017, a team of law enforcement officials for the National Forest Service set out deep into the California backcountry under the cover and quiet of dawn to raid a major grow. By the time they reached the cultivation site, however, the growers had fled the camp, leaving behind <a href="https://lostcoastoutpost.com/2017/jul/22/largest-grow-years-more-58700-weed-plants-destroye/" target="_blank">58,700 marijuana plants.</a></p>
        <p>While huge in scale, finding such a large grow was neither extraordinary or exceptional at the time. But criminal groups have begun pivoting their tactics.</p>
        <p>Instead of planting one massive mega grow – increasing the risk of being spotted by aerial surveillance – drug traffickers this year have planted many smaller grows, which are spread out over the same area, according to Gabriel.</p>
        <p>And they are moving these operations even farther into California’s backcountry.</p>

        <p>Sergeant Trujillo describes that while on a recent vacation, a deer hunter far out in the California wilderness called him up from a satellite phone, after running into six growers on a remote trail.</p>
        <p>“This is late October. These guys are supposed to be done,” says Trujillo. “They are six miles in the backcountry carrying backpacks of marijuana. And this is at 8000 feet.”</p>
        <p>Some groups are planting faster-growing hybrid species that bud after three months instead of four, significantly reducing their time outside and, as a result, their chance of detection, says Gabriel.</p>
        <p>And criminal groups have also gone as far as creating throwaway or decoy sites to lure law enforcement away from more important cultivation areas.</p>
        <p>The uptick in private land grows coming back hot for toxic chemicals such as carbofuran and methamidophos in 2018, suggests that criminal organizations may be also be turning towards private lands.</p>
        <p>“On private lands they’re finding more chemicals at sites that they’ve never encountered before,” says Mourad. “We’re talking about these drug trafficking organizations taking their recipe and throwing it on private lands.”</p>
        <p>A raid in October, led by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, netted 11 heavily armed individuals who had been using Carbofuran, Methamidophos and Avermectin B1 pesticides on a private land grow, much of which may have spilled into the nearby watershed.</p>

        <h3>A classic case of the balloon effect</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <div class="bod">
        <p>The cat and mouse game of increasingly aggressive efforts by law enforcement spawning countermoves or adaptations by criminal entrepreneurs -- oftentimes with devastating environmental impacts -- is nothing new in the long history of cannabis interdiction.</p>
        <p>In the 1970’s, President Nixon -- one of marijuana’s staunchest opponents – funded widespread interdiction efforts in Mexico. At the time almost all the weed being smoked in the US came from south of the border. Part of Nixon’s effort included spraying marijuana cultivations in Mexico with paraquat, a highly poisonous herbicide, explains Silvaggio.</p>
        <p>The fear of smoking contaminated marijuana, or “paraquat pot” as it was called, encouraged many Americans – specifically the back-to-the-landers, or hippies of the 60s and 70s -- to start cultivating cannabis in the US, says Silvaggio. The tens of thousands of private land marijuana grows in the “Emerald Triangle” – the area of northern California encompassing Humboldt, Mendocino, and Trinity County, renown for its cannabis production – is a direct result of this policy.</p>
        <p>“Without all of these efforts,” says Silvaggio, “people would still be smoking shitty Mexican weed or weed from Colombia.”</p>
        <p>When Reagan became president a few years later, he implemented a more intense version of the “War on Drugs”, specifically targeting the Emerald Triangle. By “flying military helicopters all over hell” and seizing individuals’ private property, explains Silvaggio, many of these growers moved either onto public lands or inside, where they utilized hulking diesel generators, which often leaked fuel, to power their indoor operations.</p>
        <p>“In each era, every effort by the feds to stop cannabis led to environmental issues,” says Silvaggio.</p>
        <p>The rise in public land marijuana grows – many of which are linked to drug trafficking organizations in Mexico – marks the latest chapter in this saga and highlights one of the more unseen and understudied effects of 9/11.</p>
        <p>It was also another example of the “balloon effect”, where interdiction efforts displaces drug production to new areas.</p>
        <p>As part of the fallout from 9/11, the US government began to more tightly secure the nation’s borders, says DEA Agent Patrick Kelly, who formerly coordinated the organization’s eradication program in California. Along the nation’s Southwest border – which includes California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas -- additional fencing went up, more border patrol agents were employed, and interdiction efforts intensified, says Kelly, resulting in a higher number of marijuana seizures, and much higher costs for the organized crime groups in Mexico growing and transporting cannabis to the US.</p>

    <div class="container">
      <div class="bod">
        <p>As costs of growing and shipping marijuana to the US increased, the command and control elements for the Mexican cartels “simply made a business decision”, says Kelly. “They began to move many of their cultivation operations from Mexico across the border into the United States to avoid US interdiction efforts there on the Southwest border.”</p>
        <p>By minimizing the risk of interdiction, shortening the supply chain, and operating on public land rent-free, criminal organizations found in this new strategy an exceptionally cost-effective business model for marijuana production.</p>
        <p>In the years following 9/11, the amount of outdoor cultivation sites spilled over California “almost like a tsunami”, says Kelly, quickly moving north from San Diego and up into all reaches of California.</p>

        <h3>Resources stretched for California law enforcement</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <div class="bod">
        <p>The 11 individuals caught in the California Department of Fish and Wildlife operation in October were released from jail several days after being apprehended. They were cited out because the local jail was already full, says Sergeant Trujillo, highlighting the issue of under-funding that has afflicted law enforcement agencies across the state since the financial crisis.</p>
        <p>Many of the illegal grows on public lands occur in rural counties where law enforcement personnel are already overstretched. And when large-scale incidents such as fires occur, they often strip what little resources law enforcement has away from tackling illegal grow sites.</p>
        <p>Unofficial data released from the Forest Service shows a reduction in the number of plants eradicated in 2018, as well as the total number of grow sites, compared to previous years. But that reduction likely has less to do with a retreat of organized crime than it does from the record-breaking fires that ripped through Trinity and Mendocino counties this summer -- two of California’s most popular counties for public land grows – redirecting the efforts of law enforcement to combat the fires, says Sergeant Trujillo.</p>

        <h3>Taking a tougher approach in prosecuting public land grows</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <div class="bod">
        <p>Few growers are ever arrested, fleeing the grow sites long before law enforcement arrives. In the past, those apprehended would be unlikely to face federal prosecution. But this year, in an effort to clamp down on public land grows and the concomitant environmental damage, the amount of cases prosecuted federally has intensified, says Lee.</p>
        <p>Yet, few of these prosecutions, if any, go beyond the low-tier day laborers slogging away at these grows, says Timothy Zindel, an assistant federal defender in Sacramento, most of which know little about the operation or are too afraid to speak if they do.</p>
        <p>These laborers are expendable for the organizations employing them, says Lee, who questions the effectiveness of deterring these organizations by putting away fieldworkers for 10 years – the general prison sentence they receive.</p>
        <p>“I think everyone agrees that that is a bad thing but the guys we’re seeing in court, the day laborers, these aren’t the guys buying these herbicides or pesticides,” says Lee.</p>
        <p>“They don’t set these things up, they don’t finance it. They just go to work. Will sending these guys to prison for 10 years act as a deterrent? I don’t think that sends a message to the cartels that you better use environmentally friendly pesticides.”</p>
        <p>The cost of prosecuting and imprisoning these fieldworkers over a 10-year period comes out to nearly $350,000 – a steep price for tax-payers, especially given that incarcerating these individuals will likely do little to stop these grows.</p>

        <h3>Machine learning to the rescue</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <div class="bod">
        <p>On one of the walls of IERC’s Blue Lake office is a map of California blanketed by hundreds of dots of varying colors. Each dot signifies a public land grow. Aside from being located in the many mountain areas running up and down the state, their distribution is random, or was, until Greta Wengert, one of the co-directors of IERC, had her “aha!” moment.</p>
        <p>The IERC is at the vanguard of studying the ecological impacts of marijuana grows on public lands. Having led innumerable efforts to clean up or reclaim illegal grow sites, their knowledge of these grows is unrivalled. Applying the same techniques she used to model species distribution for her Phd, Wengert built a similar algorithm that looked instead at the distribution of marijuana cultivation sites.</p>
        <p>Wengert used this knowledge to create variables -- such as the presence of springs and streams, proximity to forest service roads, gradients of hillsides, and canopy density, among others – predicting the locations of illegal grow sites.</p>
        <p>The first iteration of the model directed her to a small watershed, which she walked with Gabriel and found 13 grow sites that were previously undetected by law enforcement.</p>
        <p>Now in its second iteration, it has incorporated different elements of machine learning, improving its ability to identify grows. It now accurately recognizes grow sites 90% of the time, and “it is learning all the time,” says Gabriel.</p>
        <p>Unbeknownst to organized crime, the biggest threat to their public land operations may not be law enforcement, legalization, or drifting deer hunters, but artificial intelligence.</p>
        <p>Wengert is hopeful about the technology, but she is also a realist, and understands that the cost of appropriating the aerial images needed to feed the algorithm – which have to be updated each year – are steep.  Her project in the end – like many law enforcement efforts – may be shut down by funding constraints.</p>

        <h3>Wasn’t legalization supposed to end these grows?</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <div class="bod">
        <p>Many hoped that passing of Proposition 64 in California in 2016 – which legalized recreational cannabis use and allowed for the cultivation of marijuana under particular licensing agreements – would blow out the black market and bring an end to illegal grows on public lands in California.</p>
        <p>Since the passing of Proposition 64, bulk prices for marijuana have dropped precipitously in California – to $500 a pound in 2018 compared to $1800 in 2008 – which has pushed out many unlicensed marijuana operations on private lands, says Silvaggio.</p>
        <p>But for the criminal groups running grows on public lands, legalization has had little impact on their operations. While some of their product may remain in state, possibly leaking into some of the less scrupulous dispensaries in California’s bigger cities like Los Angeles, says Silvaggio, most of it flows out of state.</p>
        <p>Packed in trailers, the trunks of cars, inside gas tanks, or simply sent through the mail, most of the product grown on public land snakes its way into the robust black markets in states where it is still illegal and commands a much higher price.</p>
        <p>It’s a case of simple economic incentives, easily understandable for experts and laymen alike.</p>
        <p>“If they’re breaking laws to grow it, they’re breaking laws to sell it,” says Clark. “They’re certainly not selling it in Trinity County.”</p>

        <p>And drug prohibition represents only one kind of black market, according to David Courtwright, a drug historian at the University of North Florida.</p>
        <p>Far more common is the black market created by overtaxing a product, resulting in the cross-border effect where cheaper products will be shipped across borders to where it’s more expensive, undercutting prices there.</p>
        <p>“Simply saying that this is no longer Schedule 1 in no way obviates the pressure for black market activities. And if you tax the hell out of it, it may even increase the pressure,” says Courtwright.</p>
        <p>High taxes on cigarettes in New York City, explains Courtwright, provided a massive space for organized crime, which became responsible for 50% of the illegal cigarettes entering the city.</p>
        <p>Paradoxically, legalization in other states, such as Michigan, Missouri, and Utah most recently, could feed the demand for public land marijuana.</p>
        <p>“If you have a market and there’s not enough supply, someone else needs to start supplying it,” says Boehm, suggesting that illegal marijuana may fill that dearth until those states meet capacity through more legitimate means.</p>
        <p>“I do firmly think that if the US federally legalizes marijuana overnight, I think we would have a huge increase in public land grows. The potential demand has now just gone through the roof.”</p>

        <p>As the US goes opts for the state-by-state strategy to legalizing marijuana, a full-scale, nationally regulated market for weed is still a long way off. But even if the federal government legalized marijuana at the national level, figuring out the most efficient tax and regulatory scheme for 50 different states is a complicated task. And then there is always the issue of how much to produce.</p>
        <p>Canada, which legalized marijuana recently, is facing a significant marijuana shortage; what better business opportunity for criminal enterprises than a national shortfall in cannabis.</p>
        <p>The upshot is that Illegal marijuana grows on public lands will likely stick around, milking the illicit interstices caused by black markets, budgetary constraints, and policy miscalculations.</p>
        <p>It’s a disheartening realization, one that Burt Clark has begun to accept.</p>
        <p>“I like doing this work because it makes me feel like I’m making a direct impact,” says Clark. “But then you go back to the same site a few years later and it’s like didn’t we just clean this up. And it’s like, there goes the impact I was making.”</p>
